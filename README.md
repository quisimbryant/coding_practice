# hello-world
This repository is for educational purposes. I'm using it as a testbed for new things that I learn.

*Not meant for deployment in any official projects.*

I'm going to be treating this readme like a stream of consciousness. It'll help lessen the things I need to think about writing as I teach myself how to use Git.

I think it's best if I practice on this branch.
